### Final Project: Methods of intelligent web data extraction using large language models
Accomplished tasks with Java (before those convenient  features have appeared for "everyday ChatGPT user"): 
- eliminating token billing (by utilization of open-source LLMs, e.g. llama-3.1), 
- reducing hallucinations (i.e. made-up data), 
- enriching model knowledge base (which was "frozen" up-to specific harvest date), 
- boost of context window constraint (tokens threshold).

The application was capable to index and then interpret the content of target website containing documentation (~50K lines of HTML per page) within few seconds.
